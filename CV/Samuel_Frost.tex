\begin{document}
\maketitle
Studying Chemistry and Molecular Physics I am well suited to an internship focused on materials science.

Materials science lies on the boundary of chemistry and physics, with an emphasis on using modern techniques
to \underline{develop innovative new matierals.} Studying Chemistry and Molecular Physics this puts me in a 
well prepared position to start at the internship. I am familiar with a plethratude (I am an avid neologist)
of lab enviroments.

I instructed an after-school class on graphical programming to the younger years whilst doing my A-levels, 
this taught me how to simplify fundamental ideas to those unfamiliar, whilst enhancing my own programming 
ability.
